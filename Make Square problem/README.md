<h2 align="left">What is Square Game:</h3>
<p>Our project is more like a game called “Tetris”, it’s about putting pieces falling 
out of the top together at the bottom to form a straight line and then the
straight line vanishes.our project is a program that is supposed to take a set of pieces and use them to
form a 4x4 square without any gaps, it should automatically rotate or flip the
pieces or keep them on their original state to form that perfect 4x4 square.</p>
